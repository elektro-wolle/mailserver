# LDAP based mailserver with dovecot and postfix

**WARNING:**
> This is currently work in progress. The server(s) are not protected via TLS and 
> both LDAP clients (dovecot and postfix) authenticate currently as the admin user.
> Unless these issues were solved, this system must not be reachable by a public IP Address
 
Aim of the project is a full fledged email subsystem, that can be deployed in Ranger and 
can be administered via LDAP.

Open issues:
- [ ] additional LDAP User for querying database
- [ ] shared `dh-2048.pem` for all components 
- [ ] TLS for imap and smtp via let's encrypt
- [ ] TLS for lmtps with local CA, see https://sys4.de/en/blog/2014/11/17/sicheres-lmtp-mit-starttls-in-dovecot/
- [ ] TLS for ldap
- [ ] enable ldap-tls in postfix `saslauthd.conf` and `dovecot-ldap.conf`
- [ ] reload postfix and dovecot if new certificates were present
- [ ] description of LDAP Schema
- [ ] change project structure to make it rancher-catalog compatible
- [ ] automatically add postmaster@, abuse@, webmaster@, admin@ and root@ to all local domains
- [ ] ensure that `From: ` address is an authenticated mail alias of the user
- [ ] make mail unique within LDAP (or not?)
- [ ] add clamav-milter (ensure that freshclam is started first) 
- [ ] allow DKIM on per-user basis
- [ ] use own bind9 for the DNSBL in postfix (without breaking the name resolving of docker)
- [ ] allow optional solr reference for `fts_solr`
- [ ] add opendmarc sql-database
- [ ] add automatic sending of dmarc reports
- [ ] save mails of each user with different user-id in filesystem
- [ ] Imap shared folders
- [ ] split postfix into MDA and MTA 
- [ ] cleanup
- [x] postscreen for incoming mail
- [x] LDAP authentication for IMAP and SMTP (submission)
- [x] Mail aliases in LDAP
- [x] DKIM signature with private key stored in LDAP
- [x] Allow multiple instances of postfix
- [x] single dovecot instance for local mail storage
- [x] add opendmarc
- [x] add clamav

## Build

```bash
export SLAPD_DOMAIN=i-i-l.de
export SLAPD_PASSWORD=ulterrednEsSer87
export BASE_DN='dc=i-i-l,dc=de'
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

## LDAP config:

### New domain:
```
dn: ou=___POSTFIX_DOMAIN___,ou=mail,___BASE_DN___
objectClass: DKIM
objectClass: organizationalUnit
objectClass: top
DKIMKey:: LS0...=
DKIMSelector: mail
ou: ___POSTFIX_DOMAIN___
DKIMDomain: ___POSTFIX_DOMAIN___
```
in DKIM-Key, the base64 encoded RSA private key is expected, e.g. generated by 

```bash
opendkim-genkey --domain=i-i-l.de --selector mail
cat mail.private | base64 
```
the selector must match the `DKIMSelector` in LDAP and the DNS entry: 
```
mail._domainkey	IN	TXT	( "v=DKIM1; k=rsa; p=MIG....QAB" ) ; 
```

### New recipient:

```
dn: cn=Wolfgang Jung,ou=___POSTFIX_DOMAIN___,ou=mail,___BASE_DN___
objectClass: top
objectClass: person
objectClass: organizationalPerson
objectClass: inetOrgPerson
cn: Wolfgang Jung
sn: Jung
mail: w.jung@___POSTFIX_DOMAIN___
mail: wolfgang.jung@___POSTFIX_DOMAIN___
uid: wolle@localhost
userPassword:: e3NzaGF9K202dUVLZE0zaGNHa1Z1dFozeDVZV0xlQ1pPTDRUUGs4eFlSZUE9P
 Q==
```
the uid is the local delivery part (directory under which the mail is stored).

### IMAP shared folders

TBD
